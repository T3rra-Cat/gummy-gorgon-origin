This is a document to list all the people who have worked on this datapack and who have had their code used in its creation

Idea by: edwardthewatzo

Origin coding* by: T3rra-Cat

*A couple powers had most of the work done by other coders. These powers are:

"melty" (the state in which fully gummified players are slime-like) - created by psychobreadstick for the Slime-Taur origin, though the elements used were combined into one power by T3rra-Cat

"puddled" (the state in which fully gummified players are flat and immobile) - created by dyrris for the Pooltoy origin mod

"solid" (the state in which fully gummified players are frozen and mostly immobile) - created by gr_ai for the Ice Statue origin

Brightness - created by frucs as a general use power to increase the brightness of the screen

Sugary Diet - created by edwardthewatzo (i think?) specifically for this origin
